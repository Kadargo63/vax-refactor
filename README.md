# VaxStack: A Simple Appointment Making WebApp for COVID-19 Boosters. 

This web app can be used by patients to signup and login using their credentials to schedule appointments for their COVID-19 Booster. This web app can also be used to edit or delete appointments.

## Motivation for Development

Patients have varying time availability, and waiting times for the pharmacy is a significant challenge. This interactive full stack application addresses this issue with an easy to use appointment management system for patients to schedule their Covid-19 Booster Shot. This project stamps our portfolio during a meaningful time, and is scalable to multiple pharmacies to accelerate the process of administering the booster shot. 
  
## User Story
This appointment should be viewable for both the patient and the pharmacy. 

- AS a patient looking to receive the Covid-19 Booster Shot I WANT to have the ability to schedule an appointment SO THAT my wait time is reduced as much as possible. 

- AS a pharmacy/clinic looking to administer Covid-19 Booster Shots, I WANT the ability to view our patients appointments SO THAT we can opperate effectively and efficiently.
